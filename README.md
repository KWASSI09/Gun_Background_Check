## Project 3: Gun Background Checks in the USA By State and Evaluation of factors impacting the Checks



## Project Outline:
In this project, I created a platform/dashboard and three web pages where you can find data related to gun background checks in the USA from the years 2015 to 2022 for each state.
I also created visualizations in correlation with factors (such as Median income, firearm deaths, death rate, and race firearm violence) influencing the need for checking.  

I used a CSV file from [GitHub - BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks: Monthly data from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System, converted from PDF to CSV](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/nics-firearm-background-checks). This data shows the criminal background check from 1998 to 2022. 
I will also use the other three small CSV files and scrap the St Louis FEDâ€™s website to retrieve the median household income by state from 2016 to 2021.
The website we will be scraping from: https://fred.stlouisfed.org/release/tables?rid=249&eid=259515#snid=259516 .

### Diagram Process

The data misses out on such information as some laws do not require a background check on the person buying the gun; therefore, this information will not be logged, making it not 100% accurate but still, the most precise way to log the gun sales for us to see the trends in gun purchasing.
